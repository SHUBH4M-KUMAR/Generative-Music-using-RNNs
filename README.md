# Music Generation with RNN (LSTM)

This GitHub repository features a music generation project using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture. Trained on an Irish folk song dataset with ABC notations, the model learns patterns to generate unique musical sequences.
